# Defaulter Monitoring System

## Overview

Defaulter Monitoring System is a mobile application developed using React Native Expo. This application is designed for academic institutions to efficiently track and manage defaulters by scanning student ID cards to retrieve their roll numbers and seamlessly mark them as defaulters in MongoDB.

## Features

- **ID Card Scanning**: Scan student ID cards to retrieve roll numbers.
- **Defaulter Marking**: Automatically mark students as defaulters in the MongoDB database.
- **Backend Deployment**: Backend services deployed on Zoho Catalyst, making the application accessible to all users.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native Expo**: For developing the mobile application.
- **MongoDB**: For storing defaulter data.
- **Zoho Catalyst**: For deploying backend services.

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the Application**

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the Expo development server. You can then use the Expo app on your mobile device to scan the QR code and test the application.

## Backend Setup

1. **Zoho Catalyst**

    - Ensure you have a Zoho Catalyst account and set up your project.
    - Deploy the backend services on Zoho Catalyst to handle the ID card scanning and defaulter marking functionalities.

2. **MongoDB**

    - Set up a MongoDB database to store the defaulter data.
    - Ensure your application has access to the MongoDB database through the backend services deployed on Zoho Catalyst.

## Usage

1. **Scan ID Card**

    - Open the app and use the scan feature to scan a studentâ€™s ID card.
    - The app will retrieve the roll number from the ID card.

2. **Mark as Defaulter**

    - The retrieved roll number will be sent to the backend service.
    - The backend service will mark the student as a defaulter in the MongoDB database.
